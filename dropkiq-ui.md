# ðŸš€ Dropkiq UI

&nbsp;

The Dropkiq UI is a javascript library that brings the Dropkiq Engine to your HTML Textarea, input, or contenteditable fields.

Since many WYSIWYG editors are built on top of contenteditable, there is a chance that DropkiqUI could work without any modification. However, if your WYSISYG doesn't work, feel free to let me know at adam@dropkiq.com.

* [Dropkiq UI Github](https://github.com/akdarrah/dropkiq-ui)
* [Dropkiq UI NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dropkiq-ui)

Dropkiq UI is open source released under the MIT License. In the event that it does not work for your UI needs, it can be used as a starting point for development of a new UI (built using the Dropkiq Engine).
