### OVERVIEW

This guide is intended to quickly help you get Dropkiq up and running in your application.

For many organizations, the Dropkiq UI will be sufficient for HTML Textareas, inputs, and contenteditable elements. However, it is possible to build a custom UI frontend using the Dropkiq Engine if your application has a use-case that is not officially supported. This documentation will give you an understanding of how the pieces of Dropkiq fit together.
