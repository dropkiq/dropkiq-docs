### OVERVIEW

This guide is intended to quickly help you get Dropkiq up and running in your application.

For many organizations, the Dropkiq UI will be sufficient for HTML Textareas, inputs, and contenteditable elements.

This documentation will give you an understanding of how the pieces of Dropkiq fit together.
